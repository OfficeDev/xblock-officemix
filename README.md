Office Mix XBlock
=================
This XBlock allows for the embedding of lectures hosted on [Office Mix](https://mix.office.com) directly into an edX course. Students can then view the mixes natively on edX.org.

See it in action by watching this [Office Mix XBlock introduction mix](https://mix.office.com/watch/1vxsk29nweg3x).

Installation
------------
To install the Office Mix XBlock within your edX python environment simply run.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Production Installation
-----------------------
To install the Office Mix XBlock within your edX production environment, ssh to the production deployment and run

```bash
sudo su edxapp -s /bin/bash # change the user to edxapp
cd /edx/app/edxapp # change to where the edxapp is deployed
git clone https://github.com/beacloudgenius/xblock-officemix.git # clone this as a sibling folder
exit # exit from the edxapp user because it does not have sudo priv.

cd /edx/app/edxapp/xblock-officemix/  # enter the folder containing this xblock source
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt # gather and install requirements
